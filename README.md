# Lotka-Volterra model solving using Runge Kutta methods (predator-prey and competitve equations describing Gause’s “Struggle for Existence”)
This project solves two Lotka-Volterra models: classic equations (predator-prey) and competitive equations describing Gause’s “Struggle for Existence”. Numpy is used to compute Runge-Kutta methods.
